... but I like you! ;)

Just try a:

    su -c "git clone https://github.com/Renich/shellmin.git /"

I'd delete:

/.git*
/README.md
/INSTALL.md

No point on having those lying around.

Try:
    
    shellmin list controllers
    
If it gives you any output that doesn't spell "Error"; you're server should still be alive. Prepare to destroy it completely...
